// Returns a time counter value that increases by CLOCKS_PER_SEC every second.
// The intent here is to have more timing resolution than the default Cygwin
// implementation of clock() which has 15 ms resolution. In practice this
// implementation gets microsecond resolution. Works only on Windows. On Mac
// and Linux you should use the existing system library version of clock().
// See the project instructions for an example of how to use this function.  
// Note: LARGE_INTEGER is equivalent to a 64-bit integer (long long int).
// Return value of 0 means an error occurred.

        }
